var tababoutintro_entext = `Hello, I am Sam Li, a graduate of the Department of Information Management at Soochow University. Throughout my four-year academic journey, I built a solid foundation in information technology while actively engaging in hands-on projects and industry practices. These experiences have equipped me with practical skills in cross-technology integration and problem-solving, laying the groundwork for a well-rounded professional profile.

<br /><br />
<strong>Technical Implementation and Self-Directed Exploration</strong><br />
Since my first year, I have formed a “self-learning group” with like-minded peers, dedicating our spare time to exploring technologies beyond the classroom, including Python, Kali Linux, SketchUp, and Sweet Home 3D. This greatly broadened my technical horizon and strengthened my ability to quickly learn and apply new tools in unfamiliar domains.<br />
Beyond self-study, I also attended numerous technical workshops and on-campus training sessions, covering topics such as VR technology and Unity development, Android app development, and cloud platform deployment and applications. These experiences deepened my understanding of system thinking and cross-platform integration.

<br /><br />
<strong>Industry Project Experience | Chia Hsin Cement Group</strong><br />
During my internship at Chia Hsin Cement Group’s Audit Office (Sep 2023 – Apr 2024) and IT Department (Apr 2024 – Apr 2025), I accomplished the following:

<br /><br />
<strong>Audit Office | IT Automation and Digital Transformation</strong><br />

1. Developed three internal support tools using Python, significantly reducing manual workflows.<br />

2. Independently built an online audit workflow platform (CodeIgniter4 + MariaDB), fully replacing traditional paper-based processes and greatly enhancing efficiency and traceability.<br />

3. Managed the system from server architecture and database design to feature implementation. I also held regular discussions with users to iterate and improve functionalities, which enhanced my system design and communication skills.

<br /><br />
<strong>IT Department | System Integration and Platform Upgrade</strong><br />

1. Participated in the postpartum care center platform project, responsible for integrating the e-invoice API (provided by Pan-U E-Commerce), adjusting finance modules, and maintaining the overall system.<br />

2. Assisted in upgrading the Chia Hsin Foundation platform (CI3 → CI4, MySQL 5 → 8), completing data migration and system reconstruction.<br />

3. Utilized MS PowerApps to create digital forms, successfully replacing paper-based processes such as parking space applications, equipment loans, and travel reimbursements, thereby improving internal administrative efficiency.

<br /><br />
<strong>Assisted the HR team in creating interactive recruitment games and activity pages for campus recruitment and career fairs:</strong><br />

1. <a href="https://chcgroups.github.io/forNTU/" target="_blank">NTU Campus Recruitment</a><br />

2. <a href="https://chcgroups.github.io/for_yourator/" target="_blank">Yourator Career Fair</a><br />

3. <a href="https://chcgroups.github.io/forFJU/" target="_blank">FJU Campus Recruitment</a><br />

4. <a href="https://chcgroups.github.io/forfun/game" target="_blank">Interactive Online Quiz Game</a>

<br /><br /><font color="orange"><strong>
Projects involved CodeIgniter 3/4, MySQL, API integration, basic front-end interaction, and internal MIS maintenance.
</strong></font><br /><br />
Additionally, I built a personal website to showcase my projects and skills, and I continue to update and maintain it:<br />
About Me – <a href="https://samlichhan.github.io/about-me/" target="_blank">Personal Portfolio Website</a><br />

<br /><strong>Language Skills and International Communication</strong><br />
In 2022, I completed an “Advanced International English Communication” course focused on business and technology-related English. Upon completion, I also improved my TOEIC score.<br />
I regularly read English technical documentation and follow international developer communities and tutorials to continuously sharpen both my language and technical proficiency.

<br /><br /><strong>Attitude and Future Outlook</strong><br />
With strong self-motivation, a high sense of responsibility, and excellent communication and coordination skills, I am accustomed to solving problems through experimentation and validating technologies through practical application. I look forward to applying my expertise and making meaningful contributions in my future role.

<br /><br />
This is my self-introduction. I sincerely hope for the opportunity to interview with your esteemed company.
                            `;
